# React Native Food Delivery App

This repository contains a **food delivery application** built using **React Native, Expo, TypeScript** for the frontend and **Sanity** as a content management system (CMS) for the backend.

## Features
- Browse restaurants and dishes
- Add items to the cart and place orders
- View restaurant information, including ratings, images, and addresses
- Responsive UI with support for both iOS and Android platforms
- Backend content management using Sanity

## Folder Structure

- `client`: Contains the React Native frontend code built with Expo and TypeScript.
- `server`: Contains the backend code managed with Sanity for storing and managing restaurant and dish information.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend (client)
- **React Native**: For building mobile apps
- **Expo**: Development toolchain for React Native apps
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for JavaScript
- **Tailwind**: Native wind is used for styling
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management (cart, user data)
- **React Navigation**: For navigation between screens

### Backend (server)
- **Sanity CMS**: A headless content management system used to manage restaurant and dish content
- **Node.js**: Server-side framework (if applicable, for managing server-side logic)
- **Sanity Studio**: For handling CMS content

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following tools installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (LTS version)
- **Expo CLI** (to run the React Native app)
- **Sanity CLI** (to manage the Sanity backend)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/food-delivery-app.git](https://github.com/Asad-Saeed/react-native-food-delivery-app.git)
cd food-delivery-app
```

### 2. Setup the Client (Frontend)
Navigate to the `client` folder and install the dependencies:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

#### Run the Expo App
```bash
npx expo start
```

You can open the app on an emulator or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app.

### 3. Setup the Server (Backend)
Navigate to the `server` folder and install the dependencies:
```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

#### Run Sanity Studio
```bash
npx sanity start
```

This will start the Sanity Studio, allowing you to manage restaurant and dish data through the CMS interface.

## Customization
You can customize the app and content by modifying the following:
- **Frontend (React Native) UI**: Modify screens and components in the `client` folder
- **Backend (Sanity)**: Add or update schema for restaurant and dish content in the `server` folder
